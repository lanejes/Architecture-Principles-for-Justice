# 5-star maturity model

We have some early ideas for a maturity model which would inform architectural governance approaches. Low-star systems would held to account for only a subset of the principles. This helps us define the most effective routes for improving less mature systems. The maturity model primarily uses the ability to change as a proxy for the many, complex factors around technical maturity.
